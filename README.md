# Unit Economics with Python

## Project Overview

This project is designed to analyze and understand unit economics using Python. Unit economics refers to the revenue and costs associated with a single unit of a product or service. The primary focus of this project is to demonstrate how to calculate key unit economic metrics and visualize the results using Python.

## Project Structure

The project contains the following files:

- Unit Economics with Python.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with the project code.
- data/: Directory to store input data files.
- requirements.txt: List of Python libraries required to run the project.
- README.md: Documentation for the project.


### Files Description:
- **Unit Economics with Python.ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook that contains all the Python code for analyzing unit economics.
- **data/**: This folder should contain any datasets you need for the analysis.
- **requirements.txt**: A text file listing all the Python libraries required for the project.

## Installation

To set up and run the project, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
```
### 2. Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed. Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the necessary Python packages, such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, etc.

### 3. Set Up Jupyter Notebook
If you don't have Jupyter Notebook installed, you can install it by running:
```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Running the Project
### 1. Open the Jupyter Notebook
To open the Jupyter notebook in your browser, run the following command in your terminal:
```
jupyter notebook
```
This will open a Jupyter Notebook server in your browser, where you can interact with the `Unit Economics with Python.ipynb` notebook.

### 2. Load the Data
The notebook is designed to read and analyze data from files located in the `data/` directory. Ensure that the data files are placed in this folder before running the notebook. The required data may include:

- **Revenue Data**: Data on revenue generated by individual units.
- **Cost Data**: Data on costs associated with producing or delivering a single unit.

You can adjust the notebook to match your specific dataset.

### 3. Run the Notebook
The notebook is structured in sections that explain each part of the analysis. Execute each cell sequentially by clicking "Run" or pressing `Shift + Enter`.

The notebook will walk you through:
- Loading and cleaning the data.
- Calculating key unit economics metrics such as Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV), Contribution Margin, Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), and Payback Period.
- Visualizing the results using charts and graphs.

## Key Steps and Features

### 1. Data Import
The notebook includes steps to import all the required datasets (e.g., revenue data, cost data) from the `data/` directory. 

### 2. Unit Economics Calculations
The notebook covers:
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: The cost incurred to acquire a new customer.
- **Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**: The average revenue generated per user over a specific period.
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**: The direct costs attributable to the production of the goods sold.
- **Gross Margin**: The percentage of total revenue that exceeds the cost of goods sold.
- **Lifetime Value (LTV)**: The estimated total revenue a customer will bring over their lifetime.
- **LTV/CAC Ratio**: A key metric that compares the lifetime value of a customer to the cost of acquiring them.

### 3. Analysis
The notebook provides a section for analyzing the results, giving insights into the profitability and scalability of the business model.
